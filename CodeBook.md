CodeBook Description This codebook provides descriptions of the variables, data and transformations that were performed to clean up and work the data. The sources can be found in the readme document.

Libraries Required for Processing/Cleaning reshape2, dplyr and data.table

Datasets, files and variables included in this project are as follows: 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

The data was averaged based on volunteer subject and activity group Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 through 30; activity column consists of the following 6 types:

WALKING WALKING_UPSTAIRS WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS SITTING STANDING LAYING Tidy Dataset The Tidy data contains 180 rows and 68 columns, each row contains the averaged variables for each subject and each performance activity.
